# classify-bash

Classifies a shell command against a strict whitelist of read-only forms, so an
agent CLI can skip its permission prompt for commands that cannot have a side
effect. Parsing is a real AST walk over `mvdan.cc/sh/v3/syntax`, not pattern
matching.

The classifier is host-agnostic and reached through `check`. Host wire formats
live behind subcommands: `hook` speaks Claude Code's `PreToolUse` protocol, and
pi / oh-my-pi are integrated through extension shims that call `check`.

## Commands

```
classify-bash check '<command>'      classify one command from argv
classify-bash check --stdin          classify the command read from stdin
    --json                           print {"class","reason"} on stdout
    --on-unknown-ast=fail|fallthrough
  exit 0 = read-only, 1 = not read-only, 2 = this binary is broken or misused

classify-bash hook --mode=<mode>     run as a Claude Code PreToolUse hook
    --mode=claude-strict|claude-lenient
    --on-unknown-field=fail|log|ignore   (overrides --mode)
    --on-unknown-ast=fail|fallthrough    (overrides --mode)
    --log --log-to=auto|journal|file --log-file=PATH

classify-bash doctor                 report schema drift and compatibility
    --since=DATE|Nd|all              window for actionable findings (default 30d)
```

**`check` is the integration contract.** Prefer `--stdin` over argv in a shim: no
`ARG_MAX` ceiling, no shell-escaping round trip, and the command never appears in
the process table or a shell history. Exit 2 is deliberately distinct from 1 so a
caller can tell "this binary is broken" from "this command is not safe", and warn
once rather than silently downgrading every command.

Integrating another agent CLI means calling `check` from whatever that host calls
a pre-execution hook. The shipped shims (below) are worked examples.

## Design

- **Allow-only, and it must stay that way.** The tool only ever *adds* an allow.
  Unsafe or unclassifiable commands fall through to the host's own permission
  flow. A bug here can at worst fail to accelerate; it must never block. This is
  why exit 2 is reserved so narrowly — under `PreToolUse`, exit 2 *blocks the
  tool*, so anything that can exit 2 can take the Bash tool down.
- **The engine cannot exit.** Classification is a pure function returning a
  `Class` (`ReadOnly` / `NotReadOnly` / `Unparseable`), never a permission
  decision — what "not read-only" should cost a user is the host's business, and
  the supported hosts disagree about it. `NotReadOnly` is the zero value so a
  forgotten branch degrades to the safe answer.
- **Strict whitelist.** Every command, subcommand, and flag is enumerated
  positively in `internal/engine/commands.go`. Unknown command, unknown
  subcommand, or unknown flag on a known command → fall through. We never write
  "allow X except when Y" because a future release may introduce a Z we did not
  anticipate.
- **Defensive contract, but never at the cost of blocking.** The event must
  declare `hook_event_name == "PreToolUse"` and `tool_name == "Bash"` and carry a
  non-empty command; anything else **falls through** (exit 0, empty stdout) and is
  recorded as an `undecodable` log line. **An unknown field withholds the allow
  but never blocks** (the default, `--on-unknown-field=withhold`) — a field the
  harness adds after this binary was built is recorded as `schema_drift`, and the
  call falls through to the host's normal prompt rather than being auto-approved.
  The rule: we do not hand out an auto-approval while blind to part of the
  payload, and we do not take the Bash tool down over a harness addition either
  (rejecting such fields is what took the Bash tool down for entire sessions,
  repeatedly; see DESIGN.md). Enumerate the field to silence the record and
  restore acceleration.

## Failure modes

`hook` — nothing here blocks except by explicit request:

| Situation                                           | Exit | Stdout      | Stderr                          |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Command matches the whitelist                       | 0    | allow JSON  | empty                           |
| Command is unsafe, unknown, or has an unknown flag  | 0    | empty       | empty                           |
| Bash parser refuses the input                       | 0    | empty       | empty                           |
| Unknown field in the event (default `withhold`)     | 0    | empty       | empty (logged as `schema_drift`)|
| Unknown field under `--on-unknown-field=log`        | 0    | as normal   | empty (logged as `schema_drift`)|
| Undecodable / wrong event / empty command           | 0    | empty       | empty (logged as `undecodable`) |
| Unknown field **under `--on-unknown-field=fail`**   | 2    | empty       | `classify-bash: unknown field(s): ...` |
| Bad `--log-*` flag                                  | 2    | empty       | `classify-bash: bad flag: ...`  |
| Unknown `mvdan/sh` AST node kind (unless `--on-unknown-ast=fallthrough`) | 2 | empty | `classify-bash: unknown ...` |
| Writing the allow JSON fails (full disk, closed pipe) | 2  | —           | `classify-bash: write stdout: ...` — still blocks; see FUTURE-WORK |

`check` — a verdict, not a permission decision:

| Situation | Exit | Stdout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only | 0 | verdict JSON with `--json`, else empty |
| Not read-only, or undetermined | 1 | as above |
| Bad flag, missing/ambiguous command | 2 | empty (message on stderr) |

A usage error exits **1**, never 2 — a mis-invocation must not be able to block a
tool call.

### Modes

`--mode` is a preset over the two strictness axes, which are otherwise
independent of which host adapter is in use:

| Mode | `--on-unknown-field` | `--on-unknown-ast` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude-strict` | `fail` | `fail` |
| `claude-lenient` | `withhold` | `fallthrough` |
| *(legacy bare invocation)* | `withhold` | `fail` |

**Use `claude-lenient`.** It never blocks a call over something it does not
recognise, and it never auto-approves while blind to part of the payload.
`--on-unknown-field=log` (classify as if the field were absent) is available as an
override, and was the fork's lenient default before the 2026-10-23 merge.
**Choose `claude-strict` knowingly.** `--on-unknown-field=fail` is the behaviour
that blocked every Bash call for whole sessions when the harness added a field,
and every unknown field ever observed has been a benign addition. It is offered
because the axis should exist, not because failing is recommended. Either axis
can be overridden per invocation.

## Logging (opt-in)

Off by default — the hook stays silent on fall-through. When enabled with `--log`,
every **non-allowed** command is recorded as one best-effort JSON line, as are the
`undecodable`, `schema_drift` and `failloud` cases, and — on the legacy bare
invocation only — a `deprecated_invocation` record on every call. Allowed commands
are otherwise never logged. Logging can only fail to record — it never changes the
decision and never blocks a call.

Because unknown fields never block, `schema_drift` records are how you learn the
harness changed shape: enumerate the reported field on the struct in
`internal/adapter/claude/event.go` to silence it (and, under `withhold`, restore
acceleration for payloads carrying it).

| Flag         | Default                              | Meaning                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--log`      | off                                  | enable logging                                                                |
| `--log-to`   | `auto`                               | `auto` (journal if reachable, else file), `journal` (strict), or `file`       |
| `--log-file` | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/classify-bash/log`  | file path for `file`, and the `auto` fallback (then `~/.local/state/...`)      |

Each record is one line:

```json
{"ts":"2026-…Z","kind":"fallthrough","command":"rm -rf /tmp/x"}
{"ts":"2026-…Z","kind":"schema_drift","command":"","reason":"surprise"}
{"ts":"2026-…Z","kind":"undecodable","command":"","reason":"decode stdin: unexpected end of JSON input"}
```

`reason` appears for every kind except `fallthrough`; `orig_len` (original byte length)
appears only when the command was truncated (4 KB cap). On systemd the journal
sink lands in journald via `/dev/log` — query `journalctl -t classify-bash` and
grep the message. The journal sink is **Linux/macOS only** (it uses `log/syslog`);
on Windows/Plan9 it is unavailable, so `auto` uses the file and `journal` drops.

**Strictness is split by failure class:** log *writes* are best-effort (every
error swallowed), but log *config* is validated strictly — a bad flag exits 2 and
blocks the call, the same posture as the JSON decoder. So `--log-to=typo` will
stop every Bash call until fixed; this is intentional (you hear about a
misconfigured logger immediately rather than silently not logging). See DESIGN.md.

**Privacy:** records are the literal commands, verbatim. The default path is under
`$XDG_STATE_HOME`/`$HOME` (resolved at runtime, never hardcoded). On a shared or
recorded host, treat the log as containing whatever Claude tried to run, and scope
its location and retention accordingly.

## Build and test

The sub-flake exposes a Go-aware dev shell and a buildGoModule package.

```bash
# Dev shell with go, gopls, gotools, delve.
nix develop

# Inside the shell:
go mod tidy
go test ./...

# Build the binary as a Nix derivation:
nix build

# Run the test corpus via `nix flake check`:
nix flake check
```

`nix flake check` runs two checks: the test corpus and a `go-licenses` guard that
fails on any non-permissive dependency license. `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES` — generated
by `scripts/gen-third-party-licenses.sh` — reproduces the bundled dependencies'
notices (goawk/MIT, mvdan/sh/BSD-3-Clause) for **binary** redistribution.

### Without Nix

It is a plain Go module — no Nix required to build or install:

```bash
# From a checkout:
go build ./...                # binary lands as ./classify-bash
go test ./...
```

> **Note on `go install …@latest`.** The module path is still
> `github.com/shabbir-genetech/classify-bash`, so `go install` of that path
> fetches **upstream**, not this fork — upstream does not have the fail-open
> decoder or the subcommands. Build from a checkout, or use the Nix package.

Put the resulting binary on `$PATH` and register it the same way (see
[Registration](#registration)). Two notes:

- **The goawk dependency is a `replace`-pinned fork** (it re-exports goawk AST
  types `styleAwk` needs). The fork is **public**
  (`github.com/shabbir-genetech/goawk`), so `go build`/`go install` resolves it via
  the module proxy with no extra setup.
- **Platform support: Linux and macOS.** Windows/Plan9 build too, but the
  **journal** sink is unavailable there (it uses `log/syslog`, which those
  platforms lack), so `--log-to=journal` is a no-op and `--log-to=auto` always
  uses the file. The journal proper needs systemd (Linux). For a fully static
  binary, `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build` (the journal sink imports `net`).

## Manual smoke test

The host-agnostic path needs no JSON at all:

```bash
./result/bin/classify-bash check 'ls -la /tmp'          # exit 0
./result/bin/classify-bash check 'rm -rf /tmp/x'        # exit 1
printf 'cat /etc/hostname | grep foo' | ./result/bin/classify-bash check --stdin --json
# -> {"class":"read_only","reason":""}
```

The Claude Code adapter:

```bash
CB=./result/bin/classify-bash
$CB hook --mode=claude-strict <<<'{"hook_event_name":"PreToolUse","tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"ls -la"}}'
# -> {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse","permissionDecision":"allow"}}

$CB hook --mode=claude-strict <<<'{"hook_event_name":"PreToolUse","tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"rm -rf /tmp/x"}}'
# -> (no output, exit 0)

# An unknown field never blocks. Under claude-lenient (and the legacy bare form) it
# is logged as schema_drift and the allow is WITHHELD, so the host prompts:
$CB hook --mode=claude-lenient <<<'{"hook_event_name":"PreToolUse","tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"ls"},"surprise":true}'
# -> (no output, exit 0)
# --on-unknown-field=log classifies as if the field were absent instead:
$CB hook --mode=claude-lenient --on-unknown-field=log <<<'{"hook_event_name":"PreToolUse","tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"ls"},"surprise":true}'
# -> {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"PreToolUse","permissionDecision":"allow"}}
# Under claude-strict it exits 2 and blocks the call.
```

Logging is off by default. Enable it (here to a file) and a non-allowed command is
recorded as one JSON line; allowed commands are not:

```bash
$CB hook --mode=claude-lenient --log --log-to=file --log-file=/tmp/cb.log \
  <<<'{"hook_event_name":"PreToolUse","tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"rm -rf /tmp/x"}}'
cat /tmp/cb.log
# -> {"ts":"…Z","kind":"fallthrough","command":"rm -rf /tmp/x"}

# A bad flag is the one config path that is strict by design — operator error at
# the registration site, which nothing upstream can cause.
$CB hook --mode=claude-lenient --log --log-to=banana <<<'…'
# -> classify-bash: bad flag: unknown --log-to "banana" (want auto, journal, or file)
# -> (exit 2)
```

With `--log-to=auto` on a systemd host (a live `/dev/log`), records go to the
journal instead of the file — read them with `journalctl -t classify-bash`.

## Registration

Once the binary is on `$PATH`, add this to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {"type": "command", "command": "classify-bash hook --mode=claude-lenient --log --log-to=auto"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`--log --log-to=auto` turns on the audit log (see [Logging](#logging-opt-in));
drop those flags for silent operation. `claude-lenient` is recommended for a
deployed registration — see the mode table above for what `claude-strict` costs.

A **flags-only invocation without the `hook` subcommand still works**, logging a
`deprecated_invocation` record. That compatibility path exists so the binary and
the host's registration never have to be updated atomically; without it, a
mismatch leaves you needing the Bash tool to repair the Bash tool. It will be
removed in a future release — move registrations to the `hook` form.

## Agent CLI shims

The Nix package installs worked integrations for two other agent CLIs at
`$out/share/classify-bash/`, with this binary's absolute path substituted in
(override with `CLASSIFY_BASH_BIN`):

- **`omp.ts`** — oh-my-pi. Re-registers the built-in `bash` tool with an approval
  function that drops read-only commands to the `read` tier, so they auto-approve
  while everything else keeps prompting. An *accelerator*: it only ever lowers the
  tier, so with the shim absent or broken you get oh-my-pi's own default.
- **`pi.ts`** — pi. pi has no approval system and its `tool_call` hook can only
  block, so there is no prompt to remove; this shim *installs* a baseline instead
  — silent for read-only, confirm otherwise, block when headless. That is a
  behaviour change to a CLI that currently prompts for nothing, so opt in
  deliberately.

Both catch every internal error: pi and oh-my-pi each fail **closed** on a handler
error, so an uncaught exception would block every bash call.

```bash
omp -e /path/to/share/classify-bash/omp.ts
pi  -e /path/to/share/classify-bash/pi.ts
```

## Extending the whitelist

1. Audit ALL flags in the manpage for the command you want to add. Pick the
   ones that cannot mutate state.
2. **For every flag that takes a value, ask what the value *is*.** "Read-only
   command" is not enough — a reader can hand its argument to `execve`. Reject
   any flag whose value is:
   - **a program name or path** — `jj --tool`, `sort --compress-program`,
     `rg --pre`, `git -c core.pager=…`, `--exec`/`--editor`/`--pager`/`--filter`
     shapes generally;
   - **text the tool will evaluate** — `nix eval --expr`/`--file`/`--apply`
     (Nix reads files and reaches the network), any `--eval`/`--script` shape;
   - **a config key/file that can set either of the above** — `jj --config`
     sets `ui.pager`, which the read-only subcommands then spawn.

   Each of these was found *shipped* in this whitelist, not hypothesised. The
   rule: **a flag whose value is a program — or a program text the tool will
   evaluate — is an exec path however read-only the subcommand looks.** When in
   doubt, run the command with the flag pointed at a script that touches a
   marker file, and check whether the marker appears.
3. Add a `commandSpec` entry in `internal/engine/commands.go` enumerating those flags
   positively. Document any deliberately-excluded flags in a comment so
   future reviewers see that they were considered — and say *which* kind of
   exclusion it is: a demonstrated exec/write path, or merely no logged demand.
   Conflating the two makes the next reader distrust the whole list.
4. Add `TestMustAllow` cases for the new safe forms and `TestMustNotAllow` cases
   for each known write-mode flag, each exec-path flag from step 2, plus an
   `--unknown-flag` form. If you implement a deferred feature (e.g. a new flag
   style), also move the now-supported cases out of `TestNotYetAllowed` into
   `TestMustAllow`.
5. `nix flake check` must pass before the change can be trusted.

To also let a command receive an **attacker-controlled argv token** — be
**wrappable by `xargs`** *and* accept a `"$(...)"` command-substitution operand —
set `ArgvDataSafe: true` on its spec in `internal/engine/commands.go`. Only do so if it clears a
*stronger* bar than the whitelist itself: it must have **no write/mutate path under
any argv at all** (because xargs appends stdin items, and `$(...)` injects an
operand value, that the classifier never sees). A command whose spec merely
*excludes* a write flag (e.g. `sort`'s `-o`, `date`'s `-s`) does **not** qualify —
the injected token could supply that flag. Add a `mustAllow` `xargs <cmd> …` (and/or
`<cmd> "$(…)"`) case plus the matching `mustNotAllow`. `ArgvDataSafe` is the single
source of truth — no parallel list. See "Flag styles" (`styleXargs`) and DESIGN.md.

**`AllowAnyPositional: true`** lets a command take free positional arguments. Since
§8, `matchGNU` validates flags by GNU getopt *permutation* — a flag-shaped token is
checked against the spec **even after a positional** — so a reader whose
write/exec/network path is a *flag* (`gh repo view --web`, `journalctl
--vacuum-size`) can safely set `AllowAnyPositional`: the unwhitelisted flag is
rejected wherever it lands. The one rule that still bites: such a command must
**not** also be `ArgvDataSafe`, because an `ArgvDataSafe` command keeps the fast
path (its first positional closes flag parsing and the rest is opaque data, so
`cat file -X` allows `-X` as data). That fast path is correct only when the command
has no flag-reachable side effect at all — which is exactly what `ArgvDataSafe`
already asserts. So: `AllowAnyPositional` is free to set; just never pair
`ArgvDataSafe` with a spec that has any flag-reachable write/exec path. See
FUTURE-WORK.md §5/§8 and `matchGNU`.

**`DashValueOK: true`** (on an `OptionalArg` flag) lets that flag consume one
following token that *starts with a dash*, but only when the token is a bare
signed integer (`^[+-][0-9]+$`). It exists for `journalctl -b -1` ("the boot
before last"), where the documented value is a ±offset and so collides with flag
syntax. Note `journalctl -b 0` and `-b all` never needed it — a non-dash value is
already swallowed by `AllowAnyPositional`; only dash-prefixed values were
rejected. The digits-only restriction is what keeps it safe: it can never consume
a real flag, so `journalctl -b --vacuum-size=1G` still falls through. Do not set
it on a `TakesArg` flag (there the value is consumed unconditionally already),
and do not widen it to non-numeric values without re-deriving that argument.

## Flag styles

- **`styleGNU`** (default): standard `-x`/`--name`/`--name=value`/clustered
  shorts. Used by most commands and all `Subcommands` dispatch.
- **`styleFind`**: every flag is `-name` form (single dash, full word), no
  clustering, no `=value`. Used by `find(1)`.
- **`styleWrapper`**: transparent wrapper for `[flag…] [positional…] -- CMD
  [ARG…]`. The literal `--` is REQUIRED — without it, the spec falls through
  (this is what makes `devenv shell` distinct from `devenv shell -- CMD`). The
  tail after `--` is looked up in `safeCommands` and matched recursively, so
  the wrapped command's whitelist rules apply unchanged. Pre-`--` positionals
  are accepted iff `AllowAnyPositional` is true (used for `nix shell PKGS --`).
- **`styleXargs`**: stdin-append wrapper `xargs [flag…] CMD [INITIAL-ARG…]`.
  Unlike `styleWrapper` there is **no `--` separator** — the first non-flag token
  is the wrapped command. The command is accepted only if its spec is
  **`ArgvDataSafe`** (in `internal/engine/commands.go`), not merely in the whitelist, and its
  initial-arguments are matched recursively. The gate matters because xargs
  appends stdin items to the wrapped argv that we never see, so only commands
  with no write path under *any* argv are wrappable (see "Flag styles" rationale
  in DESIGN.md). The replace-mode flags `-I`/`-i`/`--replace` are not
  whitelisted, so `xargs -I{} sh -c …` falls through.
- **`styleAwk`**: awk-shape command line `[flag…] PROGRAM [files…]` where the
  script itself is classified by walking the goawk AST (`internal/engine/awk.go`). Allowed
  pre-program flags are short-only and take values (`-F sep`, `-v var=val`);
  the first non-flag positional is the awk program, parsed via
  `github.com/benhoyt/goawk/parser` and accepted only when every node passes
  the positive whitelist below. Trailing positionals are input files.
  The `-f script.awk` script-load form, the `-e prog` multi-program form, and
  gawk extensions (`-i`, `-l`, `--long-flags`) are deliberately not in v1.
  Inside the awk program:
    - `print`/`printf` with any redirection (`>`, `>>`, `|`) → reject
    - `getline` from a pipe or a file → reject
    - `system(...)` (and other builtins not on the allowlist: `close`,
      `fflush`) → reject
    - User-defined functions (definition or call) → reject
    - Everything else (field/var refs, arithmetic, string ops, control flow,
      `length`/`substr`/`sprintf`/`gsub`/`split`/...) → recurse and accept

### Deferred wrapper shapes

These are useful but each needs its own style/handling — bundling them with v1
would obscure the design.

- **Flag-introduced** (`nix develop -c CMD`, `xargs -I{} CMD …`) — needs a
  `WrapFlag` variant naming which flag introduces the wrapped command. (Plain
  `xargs CMD` is handled by `styleXargs`; only the replace-mode `-I{}` form,
  which inserts the stdin item mid-argv, remains deferred.)
- **Inline** (`env VAR=val CMD`, `nice CMD`, `nice -n 10 CMD`) — first
  non-flag positional starts the wrapped command, no `--` required.
- **AST-level** (`time CMD`) — bash parses `time` as `TimeClause`, currently
  rejected in `classifyCmd`. Would add a recursive case there.
